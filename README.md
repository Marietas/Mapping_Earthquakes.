# Mapping_Earthquakes.

## Overview of the project
This project aimed to create an earthquake map with a different overlay to show the earthquake data concerning the tectonic plates and the location of the earth. 

This analysis also offers the opportunity to identify all the earthquakes with a magnitude greater than 4.5 on the map. 

To make the analysis more manageable, the users can select different map views such as street, satellite, or dark view. Moreover, the users can also use additional filters like earthquake, tectonic plates, and major earthquakes.  filter by the intensity of the earthquakes
